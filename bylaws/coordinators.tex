\chapter{Coordinators}\label{sec:coordinators}

Coordinators are responsible for upholding the values of the collective as defined in Article III of the constitution. They are elected twice a year as per Bylaw~\ref{sec:elections}, and each position is open at one of those two elections.

If they fail to uphold the collective's values, a warning may be issued by a majority vote of the coordinators. Three warnings cause the coordinator to be removed from their position. A coordinator may voluntarially vacate their position by notifying the other coordinators. Vacant positions may be temporarily filled by any member through a majority vote of the coordinators. Temporary coordinators abide by the same rules and guidelines as other coordinators.
