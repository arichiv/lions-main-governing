\chapter{Dissolution}\label{sec:dissolution}
In the event that the collective ceases to exist, any residual assets are bequeathed to an organization dedicated to one of the exempt purposes outlined in Article~\ref{sec:objectives}. For the purposes of this section ``residual assets`` do not include any assets belonging to joint ventures. Assets belonging to joint ventures must be left to the adjoining parties to be disposed of at their discretion. Should any of these result in assets being distributed to an organization not dedicated to one of these exempt purposes, those assets will be instead distributed to one or more such purposes on a case-by-case basis.
