\chapter{Dissolution}\label{sec:dissolution}
In the event the collective ceases to exist, any residual assets held solely by the collective will be left to an organization dedicated to one of the values outlined in Article~\ref{sec:values}.

Any jointly held residual assets will be given to the joint party, unless the joint party is not dedicated to one of the collective's values. In this case, the assets will be distributed on a case-by-case basis to one or more organizations that are dedicated to these values.
