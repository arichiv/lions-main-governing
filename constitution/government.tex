\section{Coordinators}\label{sec:coordinators}
The collective must maintain, at a minimum, a Treasurer and a Historian. Additional coordinators may be prescribed by the collective Bylaws.

\section{Meetings}\label{sec:meetings}
The collective must maintain, at a minimum, a weekly General Meeting run by the Historian. Additional meetings may be prescribed by the collective Bylaws.

\section{Members}\label{sec:members}
To become a member, a person must have attended six or more general meetings and notify the Historian of their intent to join within one month of their most recent meeting attendance.

Membership continues indefinitly unless the member fails to attend any meetings in a five month period, at which point the Historian will notify the member of their pending removal. The member may then reset the process by attending a meeting within a month or providing an explanation accepted by a majority of the collective's coordinators. If they fail to respond within a month their membership will be terminated.

Members may terminate their membership at any point by asking the Historian to do so.

If the values outlined in Article~\ref{sec:values} are violated by a member, a majority vote of the coordinators and two thirds of all members may be used to terminate their membership.
